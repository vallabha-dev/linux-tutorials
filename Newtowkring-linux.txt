1.#List all installed packages

yum list installed

2.#Search for a package
yum search <keyword>
Example:
yum search nginx

3.yum list available git # to check git package is there or not if yes then yum install git -y

curl ifconfig.me #to check public ip

hostname -I      # to check private ip


ss -tuln         # to check active ports 
ss -tuln
is used in Linux to display active network sockets, specifically showing the listening ports on your system.

####
telnet <host> <port>
This command is used to test connectivity to a specific port on a target host.

‚úÖ Example:

telnet 10.0.15.201 22
Tries to connect to IP 10.0.15.201 on port 22 (SSH).

If it connects: the port is open and a service is listening.

If it fails: the port is closed, firewalled, or not listening.

üîπ Simple and useful for quick port tests.
üî∏ Not meant for scanning multiple ports.

telnet <host> <port> #Using telnet to test specific port


####
üîç nmap <target-ip>
nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool to scan open ports, identify services, and even detect OS versions.

üîé Example 1: Basic Port Scan

nmap 10.0.15.201
Scans top 1000 common ports.

Fast and lightweight.

üîé Example 2: Scan All 65535 Ports

nmap -p- 10.0.15.201
What it does:
-p- means scan ALL ports from 1 to 65535 (full range).

Very thorough but takes longer.

Why it's used:
To find all open ports, even uncommon or custom ones.

Useful for security auditing, troubleshooting, or penetration testing.


nmap <target-ip> #Scan Common Ports:

ex: Scan All 65535 Ports:
nmap -p- <target-ip>





Example:
Let‚Äôs say you have this:

A Flask app listening on 127.0.0.1:5000

SSH open on 0.0.0.0:22

ss -tuln will show:


LISTEN 0 128 127.0.0.1:5000 ...
LISTEN 0 128 0.0.0.0:22 ...
nmap <private-ip> will only show:


PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
Why?

Port 5000 is not bound to your private IP, so nmap cannot see it.


ex: Differences ss -tuln vs nmap

Feature	                ss -tuln	                                              nmap (Network Mapper)
Purpose	     View local listening ports on your machine	         Scan a target system (local or remote) for open ports

What is nslookup?
nslookup (Name Server Lookup) is a command-line tool used to query DNS (Domain Name System) to get domain name or IP address mapping.

ex: nslookup google.com
